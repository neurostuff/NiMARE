# NiMARE Development Skills

This directory contains task-specific "skills" used by tooling (e.g., Codex CLI) to guide common development workflows in this repository.

Each skill is a short, focused checklist:

- `dev_environment/SKILL.md`: setting up and reusing a local development environment for NiMARE.
- `running_tests/SKILL.md`: running the right subset of tests efficiently in this codebase.
- `writing_code/SKILL.md`: implementing features and bug fixes in a way that matches NiMARE’s style and APIs.
- `reviewing_code/SKILL.md`: reviewing pull requests with NiMARE-specific expectations in mind.

These skills complement the main contributor docs (e.g., `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/dev_guide.rst`) and should be updated whenever the project’s development workflow or tooling changes.
