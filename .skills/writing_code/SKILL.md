# Writing Code

- check for backwards compatibility if function is public and existed before the git branch was created
- Use test driven development, write tests first, then write code to pass the tests
- use `black` to format code.
- prefer to re-use/modifying existing functions over writing new functions, check codebase for existing solutions
