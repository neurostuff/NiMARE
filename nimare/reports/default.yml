define: &heatmap_text "The heatmap presents the relative contributions of each experiment to 
      each cluster in the thresholded map. There is one row for each experiment, and 
      one column for each cluster, with column names being 
      <em>PostiveTail</em>/<em>NegativeTail</em> indicating the sign (+/-) of the cluster's
      statistical values. The rows and columns were re-ordered to form clusters in the heatmap."
define: &focuscounter_text "The FocusCounter analysis characterizes the relative contribution 
      of each experiment in a meta-analysis to the resulting clusters by counting the number 
      of peaks from each experiment that fall within each significant cluster."
define: &jackknife_text "The Jackknife analysis characterizes the relative contribution of each 
      experiment in a meta-analysis to the resulting clusters by looping through 
      experiments, calculating the Estimator's summary statistic for all experiments 
      <b>except</b> the target experiment, dividing the resulting test summary statistics 
      by the summary statistics from the original meta-analysis, and finally averaging 
      the resulting proportion values across all voxels in each cluster."
define: &explorer_text "The following figure provides an interactive window to explore 
      the meta-analytic map in detail."
