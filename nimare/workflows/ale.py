An activation likelihood estimation (ALE; Turkeltaub, Eden, Jones, & Zeffiro,
2002; Eickhoff, Bzdok, Laird, Kurth, & Fox, 2012; Turkeltaub et al., 2012)
meta-analysis was performed using NiMARE. The input dataset included {n_foci}
foci from {n_subs} participants across {n_exps} studies/experiments.

Modeled activation maps were generated for each study/experiment by convolving
each focus with a Gaussian kernel {fwhm_str}.
For voxels with overlapping kernels, the maximum value was retained.
The modeled activation maps were rendered in MNI 152 space (Fonov et al., 2009;
Fonov et al., 2011) at 2x2x2mm resolution. A map of ALE values was then
computed for the sample as the union of modeled activation values across
studies/experiments. Voxelwise statistical significance was determined based on
an analytically derived null distribution using the method described in
Eickhoff, Bzdok, Laird, Kurth, & Fox (2012), prior to multiple comparisons
correction.

-> If the cluster-level FWE-corrected results were used, include the following:
A cluster-forming threshold of p < {unc} was used to perform cluster-level FWE
correction. {n_iters} iterations were performed to estimate a null distribution
of cluster sizes, in which the locations of coordinates were randomly drawn
from a gray matter template and the maximum cluster size was recorded after
applying an uncorrected cluster-forming threshold of p < {unc}. The negative
log-transformed p-value for each cluster in the thresholded map was determined
based on the cluster sizes.

-> If voxel-level FWE-corrected results were used, include the following:
Voxel-level FWE-correction was performed and results were thresholded at
p < {fwe}. {n_iters} iterations were performed to estimate a null
distribution of ALE values, in which the locations of coordinates were randomly
drawn from a gray matter template and the maximum ALE value was recorded.
