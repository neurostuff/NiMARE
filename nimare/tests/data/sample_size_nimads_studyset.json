However, first-degree relatives of BD patients are at risk for a number of psychiatric conditions, most commonly major depressive disorder (MDD), although the majority remain well. The purpose of the present study was to identify potential brain structural correlates for risk and resilience to mood disorders in patients with BD, type I (BD-I) and their relatives. Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired from 30 patients with BD-I, 50 of their first-degree relatives (28 had no Axis I disorder, while 14 had MDD) and 52 controls. We used voxel-based morphometry, implemented in SPM5 to identify group differences in regional gray matter volume. From the identified clusters, potential differences were further examined based on diagnostic status (BD-I patients, MDD relatives, healthy relatives, controls). Whole-brain voxel-based analysis identified group differences in the left hemisphere in the insula, cerebellum, and substantia nigra. Increased left insula volume was associated with genetic preposition to BD-I independent of clinical phenotype. In contrast, increased left substantia nigra volume was observed in those with the clinical phenotype of BD-I. Changes uniquely associated with the absence of a clinical diagnosis in BD relatives were observed in the left cerebellum. Our data suggest that in BD, genetic and phenotype-related influences on brain structure are dissociable; if replicated, these findings may help with early identification of high-risk individuals who are more likely to transition to syndromal states.","publication":"The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","doi":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2204-09.2009","pmid":"19726644","authors":"Matthew J Kempton, Morgan Haldane, Jigar Jogia, Paul M Grasby, David Collier, Sophia Frangou","year":2009,"metadata":{"sample_size":null},"source":null,"source_id":null,"source_updated_at":null,"analyses":[]},{"id":"X7NRDxyq7xiy","created_at":"2025-05-17T14:36:59.037807+00:00","updated_at":"2025-07-31T08:35:30.745121+00:00","user":"auth0|66546ba3a94038ae9812fce4","name":"A Multi-Dimensional and Integrative Approach to Examining the High-Risk and Ultra-High-Risk Stages of Bipolar Disorder","description":" \n## Background \n  \nValidating the high-risk (HR) and ultra-high-risk (UHR) stages of bipolar disorder (BP) may help enable early intervention strategies. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe followed up with 44 offspring of parents with BP, subdividing into the HR and UHR categories.

Thus, sibling studies may help to identify brain structural endophenotypes associated with risk and resistance for the disorder., METHODS: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired for 28 euthymic patients with bipolar disorder, their healthy siblings, and 30 unrelated healthy controls. Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8) was used to identify group differences in regional gray matter volume by voxel-based morphometry (VBM)., RESULTS: Using analysis of covariance, gray matter analysis of the groups revealed a group effect indicating that the left orbitofrontal cortex [Brodmann area (BA) 11] was smaller in patients with bipolar disorder than in unrelated healthy controls [F = 14.83, p < 0.05 (family-wise error); 7 mm(3) ]. Paired t-tests indicated that the orbitofrontal cortex of patients with bipolar disorder [t = 5.19, p < 0.05 (family-wise error); 37 mm(3) ] and their healthy siblings [t = 3.89, p < 0.001 (uncorrected); 63 mm(3) ] was smaller than in unrelated healthy controls, and that the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was larger in healthy siblings than in patients with bipolar disorder [t = 4.28, p < 0.001 (uncorrected); 323 mm(3) ] and unrelated healthy controls [t = 4.36, p < 0.001 (uncorrected); 245 mm(3) ].

Conversely, increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volume may be a neural marker of a resistance factor as it is part of a network of voluntary emotion regulation and balances the effects of the disrupted automatic emotion regulation system.

Healthy siblings of COS patients share some of these structural abnormalities, suggesting that GM abnormalities are endophenotypes for schizophrenia. Another possible endophenotype for schizophrenia that has been relatively unexplored is corticostriatal dysfunction. The corticostriatal system plays an important role in skill learning. Our previous studies have demonstrated corticostriatal dysfunction in COS siblings with a profound skill learning deficit and abnormal pattern of brain activation during skill learning. This study investigated whether structural abnormalities measured using volumetric brain morphometry (VBM) were present in siblings of COS patients and whether these were related to deficits in cognitive skill learning. Results revealed smaller GM volume in COS siblings relative to controls in a number of regions, including occipital, parietal, and subcortical regions including the striatum, and greater GM volume relative to controls in several subcortical regions. Volume in the right superior frontal gyrus and cerebellum were related to performance differences between groups on the weather prediction task, a measure of cognitive skill learning. Our results support the idea that corticostriatal and cerebellar impairment in unaffected siblings of COS patients are behaviorally relevant and may reflect genetic risk for schizophrenia.","publication":"Schizophrenia research","doi":null,"pmid":"25541139","authors":"Wagshal D, Knowlton BJ, Cohen JR, Bookheimer SY, Bilder RM, Fernandez VG, Asarnow RF","year":2015,"metadata":{"sample_size":61,"sample_sizes":null},"source":"neurostore","source_id":"7KNm6hoLrqG4","source_updated_at":"2024-03-21T20:01:55.285477+00:00","analyses":[{"id":"rzx6wJdpAoCU","user":"auth0|66546ba3a94038ae9812fce4","name":"Lenient","metadata":null,"description":"Increases","conditions":[],"weights":[],"points":[{"id":"FYd3MfRDHeoE","coordinates":[16.0,-24.0,-34.0],"kind":null,"space":"MNI","image":null,"label_id":null,"values":[{"kind":"T","value":3.51}]},{"id":"K9TGkRLz63QX","coordinates":[14.0,-64.0,30.0],"kind":null,"space":"MNI","image":null,"label_id":null,"values":[{"kind":"T","value":3.861}]},{"id":"N4kSSwyojDzh","coordinates":[-12.0,-88.0,24.0],"kind":null,"space":"MNI","image":null,"label_id":null,"values":[{"kind":"T","value":3.829}]},{"id":"QvYnfwtkGXuB","coordinates":[-16.0,-88.0,24.0],"kind":null,"space":"MNI","image":null,"label_id":null,"values":[{"kind":"T","value":4.637}]},{"id":"SAwck8h3LCeQ","coordinates":[18.0,-88.0,-8.0],"kind":null,"space":"MNI","image":null,"label_id":null,"values":[{"kind":"T","value":3.838}]},{"id":"VP8tEE9BRkNb","coordinates":[-16.0,-90.0,24.0],"kind":null,"space":"MNI","image":null,"label_id":null,"values":[{"kind":"T","value":4.467}]},{"id":"ZkGzXZxd9YHC","coordinates":[16.0,88.0,-8.0],"kind":null,"space":"MNI","image":null,"label_id":null,"values":[{"kind":"T","value":3.458}]},{"id":"npqjSXG3hpEL","coordinates":[18.0,6.0,20.0],"kind":null,"space":"MNI","image":null,"label_id":null,"values":[{"kind":"T","value":4.322}]},{"id":"yLXpgPNo6kcA","coordinates":[28.0,-68.0,-38.0],"kind":null,"space":"MNI","image":null,"label_id":null,"values":[{"kind":"T","value":3.718}]}],"images":[]},{"id":"xYB5yzrEtJvV","user":"auth0|66546ba3a94038ae9812fce4","name":"Lenient ","metadata":null,"description":"Decreases","conditions":[],"weights":[],"points":[{"id":"9JzweTnfTvfV","coordinates":[42.0,-68.0,-22.0],"kind":null,"space":"MNI","image":null,"label_id":null,"values":[{"kind":"T","value":4.931}]},{"id":"QumVEdBuTLWa","coordinates":[-6.0,-86.0,-14.0],"kind":null,"space":"MNI","image":null,"label_id":null,"values":[{"kind":"T","value":4.381}]}],"images":[]}]},{"id":"tKb6rLkin7m2","created_at":"2025-06-15T13:46:19.009398+00:00","updated_at":"2025-07-31T08:36:23.388371+00:00","user":"auth0|66546ba3a94038ae9812fce4","name":"Convergent and divergent gray matter volume abnormalities in unaffected first-degree relatives and ultra-high risk individuals of schizophrenia.","description":"\nHigh-risk populations of schizophrenia can be mainly identified as genetic high-risk based on putative endophenotypes or ultra-high-risk (UHR) based on clinically manifested symptoms.

We used structural MRI scans and voxel-based morphometry method to examine gray matter volume (GMV) differences among 23 UHR subjects meeting the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS) criteria, 18 unaffected first-degree relatives (UFDR), 26 first-episode schizophrenia patients (FES) and 54 healthy controls (CN). We found that a number of brain regions exhibited a monotonically decreasing trend of GMV from CN to UFDR to UHR to FES. Compared with CN, the UHR subjects showed significant decreases of GMV similar to the patients in the inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, insula, and limbic regions. Moreover, the UHR transformed subgroup had significantly lower GMV than UHR non-transformed subgroup in the right inferior temporal/fusiform gyrus. On the other hand, the UFDR subjects only showed significant GMV decreases in the inferior temporal gyrus and fusiform. Moreover, we found GMV in the occipital lobe was negatively correlated with the UHR subjects' composite positive symptom of SIPS, and GMV in the cerebellum was positively correlated with FES subjects' symptom severity. Our results suggest that GMV deficits and regional dysfunction are evident prior to the onset of psychosis and are more prominent in the UHR than the UFDR individuals.","publication":"Schizophrenia (Heidelberg, Germany)","doi":"10.1038/s41537-022-00261-9","pmid":"35853913","authors":"Bei Lin, Xian-Bin Li, Sen Ruan, Yu-Xin Wu, Chao-Yue Zhang, Chuan-Yue Wang, Lu-Bin Wang","year":2022,"metadata":{"sample_size":59,"sample_sizes":null},"source":"neurostore","source_id":"U7c7XqLLsWB7","source_updated_at":"2025-06-05T06:56:03.640436+00:00","analyses":[{"id":"6zjG5AEHAnnE","user":"auth0|66546ba3a94038ae9812fce4","name":"Strict","metadata":null,"description":"Decreases","conditions":[],"weights":[],"points":[{"id":"JpnUSjuE6ois","coordinates":[-33.0,-10.5,-48.0],"kind":null,"space":"MNI","image":null,"label_id":null,"values":[{"kind":"T","value":2.96}]}],"images":[]}]},{"id":"A9xmqSj6uTGc","created_at":"2025-06-15T13:47:48.635722+00:00","updated_at":"2025-07-31T08:36:35.572992+00:00","user":"auth0|66546ba3a94038ae9812fce4","name":"Convergent evidence from multimodal imaging reveals amygdala abnormalities in schizophrenic patients and their first-degree relatives.","description":"BACKGROUND: Shared neuropathological features between schizophrenic patients and their first-degree relatives have potential as indicators of genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia.

RESULTS: Schizophrenic patients showed widespread gray matter reductions in the bilateral frontal cortices, bilateral insulae, bilateral occipital cortices, left amygdala and right thalamus, whereas their parents showed more localized reductions in the left amygdala, left thalamus and right orbitofrontal cortex.

However, the simultaneous occurrence of familial and environmental risk might prove to be a major obstacle in the attempt of recent studies to confine the precise impact of each of these conditions on brain structure. Moreover, the exclusive use of group-level analyses does not permit prediction of individual illness risk which would be the basic requirement for the clinical application of imaging vulnerability markers. Hence, we aimed to distinguish between brain structural characteristics of familial predisposition and environmental stress by using both group- and individual-level analyses.\nMETHOD\nWe investigated grey matter alterations between 20 healthy control subjects (HC) and 20 MDD patients; 16 healthy first-degree relatives of MDD patients (FH+) and 20 healthy subjects exposed to former childhood maltreatment (CM+) by using a combined VBM/pattern recognition approach.\nRESULTS\nWe found similar grey matter reductions in the insula and the orbitofrontal cortex in patients and FH+ subjects and in the hippocampus in patients and CM+ subjects. No direct overlap in grey matter alterations was found between FH+ and CM+ subjects. Pattern classification successfully detected subjects at risk for the disease even by strictly focusing on morphological traits of MDD.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFamilial and environmental risk factors for MDD are associated with differing morphometric anomalies.

Investigating healthy individuals at high genetic risk for bipolar disorder may help to identify neuroanatomical markers of risk and resilience without the confounding effects of burden of illness or medication., METHODS: Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired from 30 euthymic patients with BD-I (BP), 28 healthy first degree relatives of BD-I patients (HR), and 30 healthy controls (HC). Data was analyzed using DARTEL for voxel based morphometry in SPM8., RESULTS: Whole-brain analysis revealed a significant main effect of group in the gray matter volume in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left lingual gyrus and cerebellum, posterior cingulate gyrus, and supramarginal gyrus (alphasim corrected (<=0.05 FWE)). Post-hoc t-tests showed that inferior frontal gyrus volumes were bilaterally larger both in BP and HR than in HC. BP and HR also had smaller cerebellar volume compared with HC. In addition, BP had smaller left lingual gyrus volume, whereas HR had larger left parahippocampal and supramarginal gyrus volume compared with HC., LIMITATIONS: This study was cross-sectional and the sample size was not large. All bipolar patients were on medication, therefore we were not able to exclude medication effects in bipolar group in this study., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that increased inferior frontal gyrus and decreased cerebellar volumes might be associated with genetic predisposition for bipolar disorder.
