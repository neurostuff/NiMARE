Introduction
============

We present NiMARE, a Python package for performing meta-analyses of the
neuroimaging literature. While meta-analytic packages exist which implement one
or two algorithms each, NiMARE provides a standard syntax for performing a wide
range of analyses and for interacting with databases of coordinates and images
from fMRI studies (e.g., brainspell, Neurosynth, and Neurovault). NiMARE joins
a growing Python ecosystem for neuroimaging research, which includes such tools
as nipype, nistats, and nilearn. As with these other tools, NiMARE is open
source, collaboratively developed, and built with ease of use in mind.
