Performing meta-analyses
------------------------

NiMARE implements a number of coordinate- and image-based meta-analysis algorithms in its :mod:`~nimare.meta` module.
In the examples below, we exhibit a range of meta-analyses that can be done with coordinates and/or images in NiMARE.

For more information about the components that go into coordinate-based meta-analyses in NiMARE, see :doc:`../cbma`,
as well as :doc:`../outputs`.
