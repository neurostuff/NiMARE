    beta
        The parameter estimate from a contrast analysis.
        This is equivalent to cope images in FSL and con images in SPM.

    varcope
        The estimated variance of the parameter estimate.
        This is also often referred to as "sampling variance".

        We refer to this as "varcope" because that is the term used by FSL.
