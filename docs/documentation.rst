Documentation
=============

NiMARE is a Python package for performing meta-analyses of the neuroimaging literature.
While meta-analytic packages exist which implement one or two algorithms each, NiMARE
provides a standard syntax for performing a wide range of analyses and for interacting
with databases of coordinates and images from fMRI studies (e.g., brainspell, Neurosynth,
and NeuroVault).

NiMARE joins a growing Python ecosystem for neuroimaging research, which includes such
tools as `Nipype`_, `Nistats`_, and `Nilearn`_. As with these other tools, NiMARE is open
source, collaboratively developed, and built with ease of use in mind.

This page has a brief description of each of the tools that are accessible through
the NiMARE environment.

Overview
````````````

If you have questions, or need help with using NiMARE check out `NeuroStars`_.

There are two broadly defined types of neuroimaging meta-analyses: coordinate-based
meta-analyses and image-based meta-analyses.

A coordinate-based meta-analysis uses a set of coordinates indicating measured BOLD
activation as its input. `NeuroSynth`_, for example, performs coordinate based meta-analyses
on peak activation coordinates.

Image-based meta-analyses, on the other hand, use full statistical maps as their input.
You could use a data repository like `NeuroVault`_ to perform an image based meta-analysis.

NiMARE implements tools for doing both types of meta-analyses. It also has the capacity
to pull data from databases.

Databases
````````````

To conduct a meta-analysis you'll need a collection of neuroimaging data. NiMARE has the
ability to pull data from the following databases:

`NeuroVault`_ collects unthresholded statistical maps.

`NeuroSynth`_ collects peak activation coordinates.

Also it can access `BrainSpell`_ and pull abstracts from PubMed.

See `dataset extraction API`_ for usage.

Automated annotation
````````````````````````

A necessary step of meta-analysis is annotating data. This can be done manually. NiMARE
also offers a number of automated annotation options, some of which rely on community driven
annotation efforts such as `Cognitive Paradigm Ontology`_ and the `Cognitive Atlas`_. It also
implements several topic models and vector-based annotation models.

Activation Likelihood Estimate (ALE)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ALE methods for meta-analysis takes in activation coordinates, then models them as probability
distributions in order to account for spatial uncertainties due to the between-subject and
between-template variability of neuroimaging data. To use NiMARE to run an ALE analysis you will
require a `Sleuth`_ file describing the dataset you want to analyze with ALE.

See `Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analysis revisited`_.

Peaks2Maps
~~~~~~~~~~~

`peaks2maps`_ is a method for performing coordinate based meta analysis that uses a pretrained deep
neural network to reconstruct unthresholded maps from peak coordinates. The reconstructed maps are
evaluated for statistical significance using a permutation based approach with Family Wise Error
multiple comparison correction.
