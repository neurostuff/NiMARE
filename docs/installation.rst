Installation
============

NiMARE can be installed from pip. To install the latest official release:

If you want to use the most up-to-date version, you can install from the ``main`` branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE.git

NiMARE requires Python ``>=3.8`` and a number of packages.
For a complete list, please see ``nimare/setup.cfg``.

.. note::
    We only support Python versions that are part of the Python release cycle (i.e., 3.8, 3.9, and
    3.10). For more information, see `Python Supported Versions`_.
