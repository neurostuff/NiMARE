NiMARE Developer Guide
======================

This guide provides a more detailed description of the organization and preferred coding style for NiMARE, for prospective code contributors.

Coding Style
------------

NiMARE code should follow PEP8 recommendations.

To enforce NiMARE's preferred coding style,
we use `flake8`_ with plugins for `isort <https://pypi.org/project/flake8-isort/>`_,
`black <https://pypi.org/project/flake8-black/>`_, and `docstrings <https://pypi.org/project/flake8-docstrings/>`_.
These plugins automatically evaluate imports, code formatting, and docstring formatting as part of our continuous integraton.

Additionally, we have modeled NiMARE's code on `scikit-learn`_.
By this we mean that most of NiMARE user-facing tools are implemented as classes.
These classes generally accept a number of parameters at initialization,
and then use ``fit`` or ``transform`` methods to apply the algorithm to data (generally a NiMARE ``Dataset`` object).

Installation with Docker
------------------------

You may wish to use Docker to control your environment when testing or developing on NiMARE.
Here are some common steps for taking this approach:

To build the Docker image:

.. code-block:: bash

  docker build -t test/nimare .

To run the Docker container:

.. code-block:: bash

  docker run -it -v `pwd`:/home/neuro/code/NiMARE -p8888:8888 test/nimare bash

Once inside the container, you can install NiMARE:

.. code-block:: bash

  python /home/neuro/code/NiMARE/setup.py develop

Maintaining NiMARE
------------------

Labeling PRs
````````````

All PRs should be appropriately labeled.
PR labels determine how PRs will be reported in the next release's release notes.
For example, PRs with the "enhancement" label will be placed in the "ðŸŽ‰ Exciting New Features" section.

If you forget to add the appropriate labels to any PRs that you merge,
you can add them after they've been merged (and even change the titles),
as long as you do so before the next release has been published.

Making a Release
````````````````

To make a NiMARE release, use GitHub's online release tool.
Choose a new version tag, according to the semantic versioning standard.
The release title should be the same as the new tag (e.g., ``0.0.12``).
For pre-releases, we use release candidate terminology (e.g., ``0.0.12rc1``) and we select the "This is a pre-release" option.

At the top of the release notes, add some information summarizing the release.
After you have written the summary, use the "Generate release notes" button;
this will add the full list of changes in the new release based on our template.

Once the release notes have been completed, you can publish the release.
This will make the release on GitHub and will also trigger GitHub Actions to
(1) publish the new release to PyPi and (2) update the changelog file.
