Our Roadmap
===========

NiMARE's primary goal is to consolidate coordinate- and image-based meta-analysis methods with a simple, shared and comprehensive interface.
This should reduce brand loyalty to any given algorithm, as it should be easy to employ the most appropriate algorithm for a given project.
NiMARE also provides an environment where comparisons between methods are easier to perform.

A secondary goal of NiMARE is to implement some of the more cutting-edge methods for analyses built on meta-analytic neuroimaging data.
There are many tools or algorithms that use meta-analytic data, including automated annotation, meta-analytic functional characterization analysis, and meta-analytic parcellation.
Many of these methods are either tied to a specific meta-analysis package or never make it from publication to useable (i.e., documented and tested) code.
