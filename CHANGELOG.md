### What's Changed

This is a big release, there are several large items we added:

## [0.0.12](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE/compare/0.0.11...0.0.12) - 2022-07-22

This release continues ongoing work on improving memory usage. We have eliminated the `memory_limit` option in our Estimators in favor of using sparse arrays. We expect to see a corresponding increase in fit times, especially for Monte Carlo FWE correction- however, we plan to address this in future releases.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE/compare/0.0.11...0.0.12

## [0.0.11](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE/compare/0.0.10...0.0.11) - 2022-01-06

This release continues fixes and improvements we've made for the NiMARE manuscript.
Additionally, we are starting to dramatically refactor how NiMARE stores meta-analytic data,
with the end goals of (1) synchronizing NiMARE data storage with the NIMADS standard,
(2) internally representing data and results in a manner that is compatible with NeuroStore,
and (3) implementing a meta-analysis model specification that can be employed with both NiMARE and Neurosynth 2.0.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE/compare/0.0.10...0.0.11

## [0.0.10](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE/compare/0.0.9...0.0.10) - 2021-10-06

The 0.0.10 release includes a number of bug fixes and improvements.
The two biggest changes are (1) support for fetching and using NeuroQuery's database, and
(2) a reorganization of how Neurosynth's database is fetched and converted.
Both databases now use a shared format, which separates coordinates, metadata, and
features into different files with a semi-standardized naming structure.
The fetching and conversion functions also now support accessing multiple vocabularies provided by these databases.

### What's Changed

#### üîß Breaking changes

- The fetching functions for the Neurosynth and NeuroQuery databases now have a `data_dir` parameter, instead of a `path` parameter.
- The Neurosynth and NeuroQuery databases are now in a very different format,
- so the fetching and conversion functions operate quite differently.
- The `low_memory` parameter employed in many NiMARE classes and functions has been replaced with `memory_limit`.

#### ‚ú® Enhancements

- Add new methods to fetch and convert the NeuroQuery database.
- Support the new format for the Neurosynth database.
- A new decoding method for regions of interest taken from Neurosynth: `ROIAssociationDecoder`.
- Custom `__repr__` methods in many NiMARE classes, so now printing the object will show relevant information.
- Reduce memory usage in CBMA Estimators.

#### üêõ Bug fixes

- Extract relevant metadata in kernel transformers for Dataset-based transform calls.
- Reference selected features instead of initial features in CorrelationDecoder.
- Separate IJK calculation from coordinate space conversion.

## [0.0.9](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE/compare/0.0.8...0.0.9) - 2021-07-04

This release primarily improves testing and documentation, but there are a few new features as well.
The new features include (1) a new "merge" method for Datasets, to combine two Datasets into a new one,
(2) a new ImageTransformer class for generating new images from existing ones of different types,
(3) a new "inspect" method for Correctors, to make it easier for users to see what kinds of multiple comparisons correction
methods are available for a Corrector type and a specific MetaResult.

Special thanks to @alexenge for the new ALE subtraction and conjunction analysis example and to @JulioAPeraza for
enhancing NiMARE's docstrings with "versionadded" and "versionchanged" directives!

## [0.0.8](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE/compare/0.0.7...0.0.8) - 2021-05-17

This release includes a number of bug-fixes, along with enhancements to how many tools within NiMARE implement low-memory options.
In addition, we have renamed the CBMA estimators' null methods.
The "analytic" method is now "approximate" and the "empirical" method is now "montecarlo".

.. warning:: Known Bugs This version contains some bugs that were identified after it was released.
\   - The ALESubtraction class from this release should not be used, as it uses a symmetric null distribution, which does not work properly for comparisons between Datasets with different sizes.

## [0.0.7](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE/compare/0.0.6...0.0.7) - 2021-02-25

This release involves two changes worth mentioning.
First, we have fixed a bug in how permutation-based p-values are calculated (thanks to @alexenge for identifying and reporting).
Second, we have changed how the "empirical" null method is performed.
The "empirical" method is now much slower, but more accurate, than the "analytic" approach.

This release successfully deployed to PyPi, unlike 0.0.6.

## [0.0.6](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE/compare/0.0.5...0.0.6) - 2021-02-25

.. important:: \ This release was not deployed to PyPi. However, 0.0.7 is the same as 0.0.6, so just use that one.

This release involves two changes worth mentioning.
First, we have fixed a bug in how permutation-based p-values are calculated (thanks to @alexenge for identifying and reporting).
Second, we have changed how the "empirical" null method is performed.
The "empirical" method is now much slower, but more accurate, than the "analytic" approach.

## [0.0.5](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE/compare/0.0.4...0.0.5) - 2020-12-31

This release is focused on fixing two bugs in v0.0.4.
One bug affected which files were packaged with the library, such that some templates were missing.
The other bug was introduced in v0.0.4 and invalidates cluster-level Monte Carlo-based FWE-correction in coordinate-based meta-analyses.

## [0.0.4](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE/compare/0.0.3...0.0.4) - 2020-12-28

This release includes a number of substantial changes to `NiMARE`.

### What's Changed

#### Major changes

1. We've added PyMARE as a dependency! PyMARE is a general-purpose meta-analysis library in Python that we now use to perform our image-based meta-analyses.
2. For image-based meta-analyses, we also now have a transforms module to calculate new image types from available data.
3. Datasets now have a number of attributes retained as properties, which will break compatibility with Datasets from older versions of NiMARE.
4. We now have multiple methods for converting summary statistics (e.g., ALE, OF) to p-values in all of our major CBMA algorithms, thanks to @tyarkoni! The two current methods for each algorithm are a fast, but slightly less accurate, "analytic" method and a slower, but more accurate, "empirical" method. For ALE, We generally recommend the "analytic" method for maximum compatibility with GingerALE. The implementations of these algorithms have also been streamlined and sped up somewhat.
5. We have a new generate module for simulating coordinate-based datasets, thanks to @jdkent!
6. A number of modules, classes, and functions that were not yet implemented have been pruned from the API to make it easier to work with. Don't worry, we're still planning to get around to them at some point.

## 0.0.1 - 2019-11-20

This is NiMARE's initial release.
NiMARE is still alpha software, so the package may change dramatically from release to release and there may be bugs in the code.
In this first release, NiMARE supports a range of coordinate- and image-based meta-analytic algorithms,
ingestion of coordinate-based datasets from Sleuth and Neurosynth, dataset searching, a set of command-line workflows,
and some miscellaneous tools like functional decoding.
